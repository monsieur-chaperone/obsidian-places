## 🌱 Background
Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue.
Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.

## 🏗 Structure and Surface
- Uranus is surrounded by a set of 13 rings.
- Uranus is an ice giant (instead of a gas giant). It is mostly made of flowing icy materials above a solid core.
- Uranus has a thick atmosphere made of methane, hydrogen, and helium.
- Uranus is the only planet that spins on its side.
- Uranus spins the opposite direction as Earth and most other planets.

## 🗝 Quick History
- Uranus was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel in Great Britain.
- Uranus has only been visited by Voyager 2.
