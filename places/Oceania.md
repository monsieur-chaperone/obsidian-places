## 🌱 Background
Oceania is a region made up of thousands of islands throughout the Central and South Pacific. It includes Australia, the smallest continent in terms of total land area. Most of Oceania, including Australia, is under the Pacific, a vast body of water that is larger than all Earth’s continental landmasses and islands combined. The name “Oceania” justly establishes the Pacific Ocean as the defining characteristic of the continent.
