## üå± Background
Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its wealthiest colony, in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy, and for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.

## üé≠ Cultural Practices
In Portuguese culture, people and relationships are considered more important than time, so punctuality is not as emphasized.

## ü´∞ Tipping Guidelines
In tourist areas, if a service fee is not included in a restaurant bill, tip 10%. Tip 1-2 euros at the bar for good service. Tipping your tour guide and driver around 5 euros each day is appropriate. Taxi drivers in Portugal will not expect a tip, but if they turn up on time, share information about the country, and generally provide good service, rounding up the fare is common. Tip porters 1-2 euros per bag.

## üéÅ Souvenirs
Hand-painted dishes and ceramic tiles, wood-inlaid items, antiques, port wine

## üç≤ Traditional Cuisine
Bacalhau ‚Äî dried and salted cod fish usually soaked first in water or milk; typically prepared with a variety of ingredients including potatoes, carrots, cabbage, or eggs and may be baked, boiled, or fried
