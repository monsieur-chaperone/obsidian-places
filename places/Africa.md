## ðŸŒ± Background
Africa, Second largest continent on Earth. It is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean and is divided almost equally by the Equator. 
Africa is composed largely of a rigid platform of ancient rocks that underlies vast plateau regions in the interior. Its average elevation is about 2,200 ft (670 m), but elevations range from 19,340 ft (5,895 m) at Mount Kilimanjaro to 515 ft (157 m) below sea level at Lake Assal. The Sahara, the worldâ€™s largest contiguous desert, occupies more than one-fourth of the total land area. Less than one-tenth of Africaâ€™s land area is arable, while nearly one-fourth is forested or wooded. The continentâ€™s hydrology is dominated by the Nile River in the north, the Niger River in the west, and the Congo River in central Africa.
