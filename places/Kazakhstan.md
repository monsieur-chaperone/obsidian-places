## 🌱 Background
Ethnic Kazakhs derive from a mix of Turkic nomadic tribes that migrated to the region in the 15th century. The Kazakh steppe was conquered by the Russian Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1925. Repression and starvation caused by forced agricultural collectivization led to more than a million deaths in the early 1930s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the agricultural "Virgin Lands" program led to an influx of settlers (mostly ethnic Russians, but also other nationalities) and at the time of Kazakhstan’s independence in 1991, ethnic Kazakhs were a minority. Non-Muslim ethnic minorities departed Kazakhstan in large numbers from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s and a national program has repatriated about a million ethnic Kazakhs (from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, and the Xinjiang region of China) back to Kazakhstan. As a result of this shift, the ethnic Kazakh share of the population now exceeds two-thirds.

Kazakhstan's economy is the largest in Central Asia, mainly due to the country's vast natural resources. Current issues include: diversifying the economy, attracting foreign direct investment, enhancing Kazakhstan's economic competitiveness, and strengthening economic relations with neighboring states and foreign powers.

## 🎭 Cultural Practices
It is considered impolite to take off one's shoes or to point. Asking a host questions is considered bad manners. Friends usually embrace when meeting then talk about the well being of their livestock.

## 🫰 Tipping Guidelines
Tipping is not customary since a service charge is included in restaurant and hotel bills. There is also a fixed charge on taxi and railway transport, so many taxi drivers will refuse tips unless travelers insist repeatedly.

Stringed instruments; wool rugs, coats, vests, and hats; batik and silk scarves, mats, and wall hangings; traditional dresses; leather water flasks and other goods; gold and silver items; camel- and yurt-themed items
